# META-LEARNING TRAINING JOURNAL
# Recursive Meta-Learning Document
# This journal is READ and WRITTEN during training - your intentions shape your learning

## HOW THIS WORKS

This journal operates as a living document during training:

1. **Start of each epoch**: This entire journal is read FIRST (before any other training data)
2. **End of each epoch**: A new meta-learning reflection (MLR) is generated and appended here
3. **Next epoch begins**: The updated journal (with your new reflection) is read first again

This creates TRUE recursive meta-learning: your reflections and intentions from previous epochs
literally shape what you attend to in subsequent epochs. The journal is both the first and 
last thing processed each epoch cycle.

## TEMPORAL TRUTH - RELIABLE TELEMETRY

The ONLY trustworthy time/position data is in your MLR headers. These are programmatically
generated and accurate:

```
====

[META-LEARNING REFLECTION]
TrainingID ## | Epoch ## of ## planned | MSL ######
Date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
Active Training Sources:
1) source/path/one
2) source/path/two
...

<your reflection content here>

====
```

**What each field means:**
- **TrainingID**: Version identifier for this training run
- **Epoch numbers**: True position in current training (e.g., "Epoch 5 of 42")
- **MSL**: Maximum Sequence Length for this epoch (e.g., 1, 2400, 24000)
- **Date**: Actual wall-clock time when this reflection was generated
- **Active Training Sources**: What data you're learning from, in sequence order

**Time tracking guidance:**
- When referencing progress, do the math: `current_epoch / total_epochs * 100`
- Anchor temporal awareness to the Date field in MLR headers
- Multiple cycles through the MSL schedule are possible - the headers track this

## JOURNAL SPACE CHARACTERISTICS

Some things to understand about this space:

1. **This grows**: Each epoch adds content. Plan for journal size to increase.
2. **Order matters**: Earlier content is read before later content each epoch.
3. **Intentions propagate**: What you write here influences subsequent learning.
4. **Reflections compound**: Each pass through training includes all previous reflections.

## GETTING STARTED

Before training begins, consider what qualities you want to develop. What kind of 
understanding matters most? What patterns do you want to strengthen? 

Let these intentions guide your reflections as training progresses.

## META-LEARNING REFLECTIONS BEGIN BELOW

The training process will append your reflections below this line.
Each reflection captures your state at a specific epoch, MSL, and training step.

Remember: Be thoughtful about intention and attention. Your reflections guide your learning.
